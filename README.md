# Solar-Powered EV Charging Infrastructure with Smart Payment System

## ðŸ”‹ Project Description
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a solar-powered EV charging station integrated with a smart payment system using QR code or RFID. It ensures power switching between solar, grid, and storage using a microcontroller.

## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Solar energy utilization with backup grid power
- Smart payment via RFID/QR code
- Microcontroller-based switching logic
- LCD Display for user interaction

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO
- Solar Panel
- Battery Management System
- RFID Module / QR scanner
- LCD Display
- Relays & Sensors

## ðŸ§ª How It Works
1. When a user approaches with RFID/QR, authentication happens.
2. If solar is available, it charges the EV.
3. If not, it automatically switches to grid.
4. Payment is tracked and displayed on LCD.
